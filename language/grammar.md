This document outlines the grammar of the SketchAnimate language, a scripting language for animating technical drawings.

## Introduction

The grammar of the SketchAnimate language is designed to describe the structure and syntax of scripts used to animate technical drawings. This document provides details on language elements, sentence formation rules, and includes usage examples.

## Expressions

Expressions in SketchAnimate are used to define actions, animations, and transitions. They are typically constructed from:

- Variables: Identifiers representing elements in the drawing.
- Operators: Such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.
- Built-in Functions: For common operations like movement and color change.

Example of an expression:

```sketchanimate
//TODO
```



## Statements

Statements define specific steps to be executed in the script. They may include flow control, loops, conditions, etc.

Example of a statement:

```sketchanimate
//TODO
```

...

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of SketchAnimate scripts:

1. Simple movement animation:

```sketchanimate
//TODO
```

2. Combined animation of movement and color change:

```sketchanimate
//TODO
```
